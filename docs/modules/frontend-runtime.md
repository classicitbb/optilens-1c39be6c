## 2026-04-13 — LED PRO route + admin rendering updates

- Canonical public route added: `/lenses/led-pro`.
- Route wiring stays centralized across `src/routes/public/PublicRoutes.tsx` and `src/config/routeRegistry.ts`, with accessibility coverage added in `src/tests/integration/publicRouteAccessibility.integration.test.ts`.
- Shared discovery surfaces were updated to point at the same runtime page: `Header`, `LensDesignGuidePage`, `knowledgeCenter`, and `siteSearchIndex`.
- `src/pages/lenses/LedProPage.tsx` now uses an embedded live demo in the hero watch panel, avoiding dependence on a locally merged MP4 during page rendering.
- `src/pages/admin/helpdesk/HelpdeskSlaPoliciesPage.tsx` now sanitizes stored rich-text HTML before rendering policy descriptions, preserving the shared rich-text rendering path while reducing unsafe markup risk.
- `src/components/admin/PdfPreviewShell.tsx` now initializes `manualZoom` to `1`, which keeps preview behavior aligned with an explicit baseline zoom state instead of a nullable first render.
