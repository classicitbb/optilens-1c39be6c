# Frontend Runtime Module Docs

Operational notes and change context for code in `src/**`.

## 2026-06-24 — Security hardening support tests

- Product-cost exposure is guarded at the database policy layer: browser-facing catalog/product flows should continue to read `addons_public`, `lenses_public`, `supplies_public`, and other cost-free customer views.
- Staff admin product editors still read/write the base product tables through `has_edit_role()` access.
- Runtime website analytics still uses direct public inserts for pageviews and web vitals, but rows must match the stricter migration checks for visitor IDs, paths, metric names, ratings, and bounded numeric values.
- Auth onboarding tests now fill the required country field and mock Select primitives in the unit test so jsdom does not depend on Radix dropdown scrolling behavior.

## 2026-04-13 — LED PRO route + admin rendering updates

- Canonical public route added: `/lenses/led-pro`.
- Route wiring stays centralized across `src/routes/public/PublicRoutes.tsx` and `src/config/routeRegistry.ts`, with accessibility coverage added in `src/tests/integration/publicRouteAccessibility.integration.test.ts`.
- Shared discovery surfaces were updated to point at the same runtime page: `Header`, `LensDesignGuidePage`, `knowledgeCenter`, and `siteSearchIndex`.
- `src/pages/lenses/LedProPage.tsx` now uses an embedded live demo in the hero watch panel, avoiding dependence on a locally merged MP4 during page rendering.
- `src/pages/admin/helpdesk/HelpdeskSlaPoliciesPage.tsx` now sanitizes stored rich-text HTML before rendering policy descriptions, preserving the shared rich-text rendering path while reducing unsafe markup risk.
- `src/components/admin/PdfPreviewShell.tsx` now initializes `manualZoom` to `1`, which keeps preview behavior aligned with an explicit baseline zoom state instead of a nullable first render.
